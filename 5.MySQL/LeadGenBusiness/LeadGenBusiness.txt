1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

select monthname(charged_datetime) as month, sum(amount) as total_billing
from
billing
where monthname(charged_datetime) = 'March' and year(charged_datetime) = 2012
group by monthname(charged_datetime);

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

select sum(amount) as total_revenue
from clients
join billing on clients.client_id = billing.client_id
where clients.client_id = 2
group by clients.client_id;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

select domain_name as sites
from sites
where client_id = 10

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

select sites.client_id, count(site_id) as number_of_websites,  monthname(created_datetime) as month_created, year(created_datetime) as year_created
from sites 
where sites.client_id in (1, 20)
group by year(created_datetime), month(created_datetime);


5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

select count(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, sites.domain_name as websites, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') as date_generated
from leads
join sites on leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-02-15'
group by sites.domain_name;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id 
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
GROUP BY clients.client_id;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

select concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client_name, count(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, monthname(leads.registered_datetime) as month_generated
from clients
join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
and month(leads.registered_datetime) between 1 and 6
-- group by leads.site_id
group by leads.site_id
order by month(leads.registered_datetime);

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

select concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as client_name, sites.domain_name as website, count(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') as date_generated
from clients
join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
join leads on sites.site_id = leads.site_id
where year(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
group by leads.site_id
order by clients.client_id;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

select concat(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) as Name, sum(amount) as total_revenue, 
monthname(billing.charged_datetime) as month_charge, year(billing.charged_datetime) as year_charge
from clients
join billing on clients.client_id = billing.client_id 
group by clients.client_id, monthname(billing.charged_datetime), year(billing.charged_datetime)
order by clients.client_id, year(billing.charged_datetime);

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

select CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, group_concat('  ', sites.domain_name) as sites
from clients
join sites on clients.client_id = sites.client_id
group by client_name;
