Overview
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language for all web pages. HTML elements are the basic building-blocks of the internet.

Understand the roles of HTML vs. CSS vs. Javascript
Understand how to incrementally break down building a web page into its fundamental components

What is HTML
HTML is the language of the Web. It stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

Its purpose is to let us communicate with the browser the meaning of the content that we wish to place on a web page. To achieve this, HTML defines a number of tags that we can wrap the contents with.

Headings and paragraphs of text
Images
Links
Lists
Tables
Forms
We're currently interested in the Elements tab. When you click on it, you should see:

<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>Hello World!</body>
</html>
In the case where your HTML document isn't "valid", the browser will try to add appropriate tags to fix it.

One of each of <html>, <head>, and <body> above are required for each valid HTML document.

Some terminology here:

Opening and closing tags
Since tags are supposed to wrap things, most tags come in pairs: one opening and one closing tag, that denote the beginning and end of content. Tags without a leading forward slash are called opening tags while tags with leading forward slashes are called closing tags.

In the above example, <body> is an opening tag - it's equivalent to you telling the browser "Hey, I'm going to start putting in body content now". </body> is a closing tag that means "OK, I'm done with body content."

Nesting
Notice that between the opening and closing HTML tags, we also have head and body tags.

Tags can encapsulate other tags. This is called nesting. Nested items are indented with a tab to make the document easier to read.

The hierarchy that rises from nesting is called DOM - Document Object Model.

Commenting
The format for commenting in an HTML file is as follows:

<p> Some paragraph content. </p>
<!-- This is a comment -->
    
<!doctype html> You may notice that this time we added the line <!doctype html> .The purpose of this line is to tell the browser that we want our document to be read in standard mode. What this basically means is that we are using the latest accepted HTML conventions. This line should be the first line in every HTML document you create.
    
<html> indicates that everything between it and its closing tag </html> will be marked-up using HTML conventions.
    
The <head> will eventually contain meta-data about the document, the external Stylesheets and JavaScript libraries that the document will use, and the document's title.
    
The <body> will contain the user content - everything in the document that will be visible in the browser window.
    
For additional sectioning needs, we will use the <div> tag which stands for division.   
    
What is the HTML PCS Relationship?
The PCS relationship is just a term to describe the relationship between tags/elements inside an HTML document. To know the relationship between tags, we must first determine the parents, children, and siblings within our HTML document.   
    
Is it really required to indent HTML code?
It's not required, but it is highly recommended, and here are the reasons why:

Beautiful-looking code can make you happy, and one way to make them look beautiful is to properly indent them.
Properly indented code leads to less time spent on troubleshooting. Imagine being stuck with a problem, and you curse the inventor of HTML (damn you, Tim Berners-Lee!) -- only to find out that you just missed a closing tag. You were not able to quickly see it because you did not properly indent! 
It's easy to browse through your own code. With a glance, you know right away which part is the header part, and which part is the footer.
It's a good coding habit. Popular programming languages such as PHP, Java, or Ruby recommend proper code indentation. Python even enforces it.
 
The "Coding Dojo: Coding Bootcamp in Seattle and San Francisco" comes from the <title> tag.

<meta charset="utf-8">
Properly encoded Web pages declare the encoding to a browser through a meta tag in the header. Without this tag, a browser may not know to switch to the proper encoding and characters may be displayed as gibberish.

<title>My Awesome Webpage</title>
This is the title of your web page, which means that when you open this page in the browser, the tab that opens it will read "My Awesome Webpage". This will be the name that it gets bookmarked with, as well as the name that is used when it is displayed as a search result in a search engine.

<meta name="description" content="description content">
The description meta tag is used by search engines when displaying results.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="my_css_file.css">
This line links a stylesheet to our page, which will determine how our HTML elements are visually displayed on the page. We will learn more about what goes into my_css_file.css in the CSS section.

<script src="my_javascript_library.js"></script>
This line links a JavaScript or jQuery file to our document. JavaScript makes our pages interactive. We will learn more about these files in the jQuery section.

NOTE: You can link to as many stylesheets or JavaScript files as you want within the head tags.
